What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: more logical Con: Have to remember to do it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple

    The files may be interdependent. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log shows the order of the commits so you can use diff on consecutive commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   Because you can always go back to before a commit if you break something.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
